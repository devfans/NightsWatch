# The Night's Watch
The Night's Watch - A simple but powerful and brave watchdog for your services to let you sleep well after you close your eyes!

```
"Night gathers, and now my watch begins.
It shall not end until my death.
I shall take no wife, hold no lands,
  father no children.
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
I shall live and die at my post.
I am the sword in the darkness.
I am the watcher on the walls.
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."

―The Night's Watch oath[src] in the GoT
